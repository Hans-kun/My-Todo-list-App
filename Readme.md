Hello guys!

This is my first python and django project i did it a couple of months back and i haven't been able to post it here because it's been incomplete but after much pressure from friends i have decided to put it up on my github page.

This is a simple Todo list and very user friendly too it has the add, update, and delete attribute. once you add a task to your list and you have completed this specific task all you have to do is click on the update button and you would see a small check box with the initials of completed once this checkbox is ticked and you hit the update button and return to the main page
 the updated task is automatically struck out with a faint white line indicating that this particular task has been updated very easy.
 You also have the option of deleting any task you find irrelevant.

This app has a little problem i haven't been able to link a fresh todo list to a new user so for now you would still be seeing my own default page i'm still working on this like i stated eariler this app is still under production if you have any ideas that you would like to share with me please do contact me on my email i would really appriciate it. Thank you
